1. “RDoC Mechanisms of Transdiagnostic Polygenic Risk for Trajectories of Depression: From Early Adolescence to Adulthood”

### Abstract -
1. Summary:<p>
        The study aims to understand the heterogeneity in the development of depression from adolescence to adulthood and the underlying genetic     and behavioral risk factors. Previous longitudinal studies identified distinct patterns of depression development, yet the etiological processes remain unknown. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed genetic variants for depression, but the significant overlap between depression and other mental disorders suggests a possible transdiagnostic and complex etiology. The study examines the relationship between a transdiagnostic polygenic score (p-factor PGS), representing genetic covariation across multiple mental disorders, and different developmental trajectories of depression. This is examined in the context of the Research Domains Criteria (RDoC) framework, focusing on negative valence, positive valence, and cognitive systems. The study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and tests multiple mediation models to investigate the direct and indirect effects of the p-factor PGS on depression trajectories via the RDoC subconstructs.</p>
        
2. Points of Attention:
       <p> The key aspect to pay attention to is the concept of a transdiagnostic approach, both in terms of the p-factor PGS, representing genetic risk across multiple mental disorders, and the RDoC framework. Understanding the interaction between these genetic risks and various developmental and behavioral factors can provide insight into the development of depression. Another point of attention is the different trajectories of depression identified in previous studies, and their associations with the p-factor PGS and the RDoC subconstructs. The methodology of these studies, including longitudinal design and the mediation models, could be useful for exploring a potential 5th trajectory. </p>

### Method:
1. Summary:
        <p>The paper presents a methodology employed to study adolescents in the US using the Add Health database, with the goal of understanding the trajectory of depression. Data collected over four waves from various groups are analyzed for the subset of individuals where genotypic and phenotypic information are available. The variables used in the study include depression symptoms, cognitive system measures, negative and positive valence systems, and polygenic scores (PGS). The statistical analysis comprises three steps: Latent class growth models of depression were fit using Mplus, a multinomial logistic regression was performed, and multiple mediation models were executed in R.</p>

2. Points of attention:
          <p>Understanding the Sample: The demographics of the subset being studied and the details of data collection. It is important to note the characteristics of the subjects, the period covered, and the size of the sample.
Variables Involved: The chosen variables (Depression symptoms, cognitive system, positive and negative valence systems, and PGS) and their definitions/measurements, are critical in understanding the overall research study.</p>
  
3. Statistical Analysis:
          <p>Each of the three steps (Latent class growth models, multinomial logistic regression, multiple mediation models) undertaken in the analysis are crucial to understand, as they explain how the researchers interpreted the data.</p>

### Results: 
1. Summary:
          <p>The results section of the paper delineates the trajectory of depressive symptoms in adolescents, culled from the Add Health dataset, presenting four distinctive classes identified using latent class growth (LCG) models: low depression, low increasing depression, high declining depression, and early adult peak depression. Each of these trajectories is characterized by unique patterns of depressive symptom development over time. The vast majority of individuals (78.9%) exhibited consistently low depression symptoms (low depression class). Other classes showed variations such as steady increase in symptoms (low increasing depression), an initial high level followed by a significant decline (high declining depression), and an increase until age 23 followed by a decrease (early adult peak depression).

    The paper also examines the association of each Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) measure (negative emotionality, picture vocabulary, novelty seeking) and the p-factor polygenic score (PGS) on the relative risk of belonging to each depression class, using multinomial logistic regression. The results indicate distinctive associations for each class: for the low increasing and early adult peak depression classes, higher negative emotionality and novelty seeking were associated with increased relative risk, while lower picture vocabulary scores were associated only with the early adult peak and high declining depression classes. The p-factor PGS was associated only with the low increasing depression class.

      The results of the multiple mediation analysis suggest that the indirect effects of p-factor PGS on depression class through RDoC mediators were significant only for negative emotionality in the early adult peak and high declining depression classes. No significant indirect effects emerged for the low increasing depression class. </p>

2. Points of Attention:
          <p>You should pay close attention to the characteristics and composition of each identified class and the role of RDoC measures and the p-factor PGS in determining class membership. Recognizing these factors can help in understanding the factors associated with distinct depressive symptom trajectories, as well as the potential influence of genetics and different psychological constructs. This could aid in identifying the nature of the 5th trajectory you are seeking to identify.</p>
