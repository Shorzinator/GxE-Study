# AntisocialTrajectory Analysis Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the `AntisocialTrajectory` variable in the context of predicting antisocial behavior trajectories. The analysis compares the performance metrics of category 4 (Low trajectory) against categories 1, 2, and 3 to evaluate its suitability as a baseline.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis involved training a logistic regression model for three separate binary classifications:
1. Category 1 vs Category 4
2. Category 2 vs Category 4
3. Category 3 vs Category 4

Performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score were used to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between each category and the baseline (Category 4).

## Outputs Analysis

### Insights from Category 1 vs Category 4
- The model correctly predicts the class around 83.79% of the time on average.
- F1-scores for category 1 show a wide variation, with some interactions achieving very low scores and others achieving high scores.
- Category 4 consistently achieves high F1-scores, indicating better predictability.

### Insights from Category 2 vs Category 4
- The model achieves an average accuracy of 61.18%.
- The F1-scores for category 2 vary widely, suggesting that the model's performance depends on the interaction terms used.
- Category 4's F1-scores are consistently higher than those for category 2.

### Insights from Category 3 vs Category 4
- The average accuracy for this comparison is 73.58%.
- F1-scores for category 3 also show a wide range, similar to categories 1 and 2.
- Category 4 achieves consistently high F1-scores.

## Final Interpretation
Across all comparisons, category 4 consistently achieves higher performance metrics, making it more distinguishable by the logistic regression model compared to other categories. This justifies the use of category 4 as a baseline. The model's tendency to predict category 4 with higher confidence could be due to its prevalence, distinctiveness, or the nature of the features and interactions used.

## Recommendations
- Consider using category 4 as a reference point for comparing with other categories in the context of antisocial behavior trajectories.
- Further analysis can be done using other algorithms or by diving deeper into feature importance to understand the factors driving the distinction of category 4.
